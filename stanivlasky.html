      <p>Stanislavski’s principles of directing and his collective theories on acting were very influential in the late nineteenth century and are still used by actors and directors today. The Stanislavski or system is a set of techniques used by actors to portray emotions on stage by putting themselves in the place of the character.</p>
        <h3 style="text-decoration: underline">How can I Utilize Method Acting?</h3>
        
        <p>Stanislavski method acting is basically in seven steps, these techniques where developed to help actors to build beliveable characters. These are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Who Am I?</li><br>
            <li>Where Am I?</li><br>
            <li>When Is It?</li><br>
            <li>What Do I Want?</li><br>
            <li>How Will I Get It?</li><br>
            <li>What Do I Need To Overcome?</li><br>
        </ol>

        To answer these questions, you may:
        <ol>
            <li>Read the script carefully to get good understanding of the characters motivations, needs and desires; by doing this you will get a better identify of the role you are playing. </li><br>
            <li>Working out how the character would behave in situations and how they should react.</li><br>
            <li>Your character’s objective is what they want and obstacles are the things that stand in their way of achieving their objective and also how far they will go to achieve their objective.</li><br>
            <li>Break the script down into bits or beats, these are individual objectives of your character and may be as simple as going into a room.</li><br>
            <li>Then determine your character’s motivation for this action, this in turn helps you to portray the emotions that the character is experiencing whilst you complete the objective.</li>
        </ol>
